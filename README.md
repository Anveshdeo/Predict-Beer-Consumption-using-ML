Beer is one of the most democratic and consumed drinks in the world. Not without reason, it is perfect for almost every situation, from happy hour to large wedding parties. If you just think about it, you already feel like having a beer, you’re not alone.

The truth is that around the world, thousands of people consume the drink regularly and also in different situations. But have you ever stopped to think about which countries are the most consuming beer in the world? 

The answer to that question is resounding: the Czech Republic. According to research by the Japanese beverage company Kirin, the country has topped the per capita beer drinking table for 23 consecutive years.
In 2015, the most recent year for which statistics are available, the Czechs drank 142.4 litres per person. That’s the equivalent of 250 pints — or one every 35 hours. But, given that minors are unlikely to be contributing to that figure, it’s safe to assume that the average beer drinker probably guzzles quite a bit more.
